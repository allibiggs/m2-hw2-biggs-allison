## Issues 

I had issues when pushing my local changes to my Github repository. Since I had not used VSCode before, setting up Github extensions and learning to use their Github features presented a bit of a learning curve. There were also some security changes on Github that I had to work through. 

## Resources

I relied heavily on Github documentation to solve my issues with pushing and merging branches. I also read through the Bootstrap documentation for the Starter files and the Bootstrap Grid.
